# Cali: A prototype

> I am going to write a simple appointment schduling application. Target
> demographics will be people familiar with the command line. It also has a web
> interface, that allows to display dates and available time slots, etc.

> We will write this in Go, we will write a small server that keep track of the
> currently scheduled appointments for a user in an sqlite database. A separate
> component, a cli tool will be able to talk to the server via an HTTP API or
> directly to the sqlite3 database for speed.

> let's start with a basic scaffold
